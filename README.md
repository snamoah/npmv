# NPMV Command-line Tool

**npmv** is a command-line tool I built to tell me the version number of a node module. It's a
lot of work for me writing `cat package.json` everytime I want to check the version of a
package. Especially when I want to find out the initial version of a package before I
update the version number.


## Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g npm-ver
```


## Usage

```javascript
$ npmv
//=> Version: v0.1.0
```
